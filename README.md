# Elevating Efficiency
Our project is about the efficiency of elevators. We want to find out how the efficiency of elevators can be improved by using different policies. We will simulate the movement of elevators and passengers in a building and compare the results of different policies.

## Usage
To run the simulation first set the parameters in the main.py file. 

Then run the following command in the terminal:
```python main.py```
